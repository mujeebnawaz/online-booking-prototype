Coach Travelling is a regular travel company and they offer to travel by coach. Most of
their customers approach them by recommendations but cannot find them directly. A
customer can book a trip by calling the company and pay the dues manually either in
advance or on the trip day. Company owners are planning to revamp the current system
and transition to a more advance online system.
